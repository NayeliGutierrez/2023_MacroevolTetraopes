# 2023_MacroevolTetraopes

Custom scripts were employed for the analysis of the Macroevolution of Milkweed Longhorn Beetles Project.

We did not develop new software for this study; hence, we offer the scripts for conducting analyses and provide references to other sources utilized.

For each section, we provide a file with a detailed explanation of the analysis, and the scripts used are provided. Additionally, whenever applicable, we provide the output files and reports from the different software employed:

## Index
- Quality control
- Genome assembly
- Ultraconserved Element (UCE) capture with custom probe set
- UCE matrix generation and partitioning
- Phylogenomics
- Divergence time estimation
- Ancestral range estimation (global scale and American scale)

Supplementary
- In silico test of the UCE Coleoptera probes on the Tetraopes genomes
