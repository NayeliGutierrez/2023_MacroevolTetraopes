# 2023_MacroevolTetraopes

Custom scripts were employed for the analysis of the Macroevolution of Milkweed Longhorn Beetles Project.

We did not develop new software for this study; hence, we offer the scripts for conducting analyses and provide references to other sources utilized.

For each section, we provide a folder with a Jupyter Notebook with a detailed explanation of the analysis, and the scripts used are provided. Additionally, whenever applicable, we provide the output files and reports from the different software employed:

- Quality control
- Genome assembly
- Ultraconserved Element (UCE) custom probe set design
- UCE matrix generation and partitioning
- Phylogenomics
- Divergence Time Estimation
- Ancestral range estimation
